# Face-mask_Detection

This project deals with detection of face mask. The augmented file deals with increasing the training dataset by using image augmentation. The model file consists of 
the neural network that is used for training and saved as Face_mask_model.h5. The Face_detection file consists of the face detection model that is done by using the 
mediapipe pipeline and the bounding box around the face is sent to the model for detection. The templated folder consists of the index and the result web pages. The 
index page is the home page which has a button that would redirect the user to result webpage where the detection result will be shown. The static folder contains the
